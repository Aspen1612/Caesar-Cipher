# Caesar Cipher Encoder & Decoder

A simple Python program that encodes and decodes messages using the **Caesar Cipher** method.

## ðŸ“œ Description
The Caesar Cipher is a basic encryption technique where each letter in the message is shifted by a certain number of places in the alphabet.  
This program allows you to:
- **Encode** a message (shift letters forward)
- **Decode** a message (shift letters backward)
- Keep spaces and symbols unchanged

---

## ðŸš€ How It Works
1. The program asks whether you want to **encode** or **decode** a message.
2. You type your message.
3. You provide a **shift number** (e.g., 3 shifts "a" â†’ "d").
4. The program outputs the transformed message.
5. You can choose to run it again or exit.

## ðŸ–¥ Example
```bash
Type 'encode' to encrypt, type 'decode' to decrypt: 
 encode
Type your message: 
 hello world!
Type the shift number: 
 3
Your encoded message is: khoor zruog!
Do you want to go again? Type 'yes' or 'no': 
 no
Goodbye!
